Learning pygame at #sehackday #8
=======

A clock, and a Snake game hopefully.


Well, I'm done
-------

Completed the two applications. Would've earlier if I knew a bit more, as everything was easy. At least I'm done now. It was a good experience.

Learned the importance of timers, how gridding and shading works. Lots of potentially expensive stuff, and definitely loads more to learn.
